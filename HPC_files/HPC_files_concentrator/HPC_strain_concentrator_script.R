# # MYRIAD RUN SCRIPT
# # 
# # This is an R script that runs a single attack to failure accroding to a set of input parameters. It is designed to be run on
# # an HPC cluster, allowing each attack to run independtly when scheduled
# # 
# # A question is how much time is spent loading the necessary packages and data as this may mean that several attacks should be combined
# # to reduce the overhead.
