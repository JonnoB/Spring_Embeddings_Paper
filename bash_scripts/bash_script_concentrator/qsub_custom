#!/bin/bash -l

# This is a bash script to create a variant of the qsub command that will allow variables to be entered such that 
# It takes certain commands that are used by the real qstat and pass arguments to the bash script allowing a single bash
# script to be used fall all graphs when the time required and the graph name are entered as arguments

# Arguement 1 $1 the name of the graph file e.g. IEEE_118_igraph N.B. do not include ".rds"
# Arguement 2 $2 the name of the type of calculation is typically either 'attack' or 'strain', although there can be variants as long as the file has name matches the structure HPC_${2}_bash
# Arguement 4 $3 the time value in format 00:00:00

#An example of running the command from a different directory to that which the submit function is held is shown below
#~/Spring_Embeddings_Paper/bash_scripts/bash_script_concentrator/qsub_custom IEEE_118_igraph strainrc 1:00:00

# 1. Request wallclock time (format hours:minutes:seconds). This is an argument of the script when it is called
# -l h_rt=$3 

# 2. Set the name of the job. This uses the graph name
# -N attack_$1

# 3. Set the working directory to somewhere in your scratch space.  This is
# a necessary step with the upgraded software stack as compute nodes cannot
# write to your $HOME.
#
# NOTE: this directory must exist.
#
# Replace "<your_UCL_id>" with your UCL user ID :)
# -wd /home/ucabbou/Scratch/attack/$1

#create the output folder
mkdir -p $HOME/Scratch/${2}/$1

#The $1 graph name gets passed to the bash file ensuring that the bash file includes the graph name in all outputs
qsub -l h_rt=$3 -N ${2}_${1} -wd /home/ucabbou/Scratch/${2}/$1 ~/Spring_Embeddings_Paper/bash_scripts/bash_script_concentrator/HPC_${2}_bash $1
