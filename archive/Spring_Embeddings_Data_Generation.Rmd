#Create edge scrambles

Create the edge scrambles that give a range of alpha values for each initial ec/alpha value

returns a data frame that contains (amongst other things), a random seed and the associated alpha value. The network edges are scrambled using that random seed.

*N.B*
This chunk requires a large number of networks to be loaded and analysed so takes a long time. doing this in parallel is reccomended. However, I haven't been able to make it work effectively so keep it in serial

#Create parameter dataframe

Base and strain HPC start up needs to be made for the permutations and the non-scramble

The parameter dataframe allows for efficient parallel processing of the large number of simulations performed in this project.

The parameter dataframe is saved to be used later on a different system such as an HPC or cloud machine.

The three code chunks should be combined into a single chunk as the differences between them are clearly minimal. This is a low priority though


The HPC parameter Array is different for the collapse set and the strain set the strain set is 480 simulations per set these are broken into 12 compute groups the numbers of the compute groups need to be specified before hand they are
1  101  201  301  401  501  601  701  801  901 1001 1101 this means that there is a different startup parameter file for strain and collapse.

##Permuted edges

This is ONLY the IEEE-118 power flow network. It has the edges scrambled/permuted AND load and demand 

```{r}
parameter_df <- generate_simulation_parameter_df(edge_scramble_keys_IEEE_permutation_path, 
                                             permuted_IEEE_118_path,
                                             collapse_sets_path,
                                             collapse_set_summaries_path,
                                             embeddings_path,
                                             replace_target_order = NULL) %>%
  mutate(graph_path = file.path("power_grid_graphs", graph_path))

save_params_for_HPC(parameter_df = parameter_df, HPC_startup_parameter_file_path, analysis_parameter_file_path)


saveRDS(parameter_df, file.path(analysis_parameter_file_path, "IEEE_118_permutation_parameter_file.rds"))
```

##Base edge scramble codes

This is ALL the IEEE power flow networks. They have the edges scrambled but the load and demand is NOT permuted

```{r}
parameter_df <- generate_simulation_parameter_df(edge_scramble_keys_path, 
                                             power_grid_graphs_path,
                                             collapse_sets_path,
                                             collapse_set_summaries_path,
                                             embeddings_path,
                                             replace_target_order = NULL)

save_params_for_HPC(parameter_df = parameter_df, HPC_startup_parameter_file_path, analysis_parameter_file_path)

#
#Params for a simple HPC test
#
#test run for HPC
#is an array of two attack only
test_params <- parameter_df %>%
  filter(permutation== "IEEE_118_igraph",
         simulation_id %in% 1) %>% filter(compute_group %in% 1:2) %>%
  mutate(permutation = paste0("test_", permutation))

#The HPC start up array
test_attack_startup <- test_params %>%
  distinct(compute_group) %>% 
  mutate(load_file = "test_base_IEEE_118_igraph.rds") 


saveRDS(test_params, 
        file.path(analysis_parameter_file_path, 
                  "test_base_IEEE_118_igraph.rds")) 

#save the parameter files for the attack simulations
write_delim(test_attack_startup, 
            path = file.path(HPC_startup_parameter_file_path, 
                             paste0("test_attack_", 
                                    gsub(".rds", ".txt","base_IEEE_118_igraph.rds"))), 
            delim = " ") #save the HPC start up parameter file. This defines the entire array
```

##non scrambled edges

The non-scrambled edges can be identified as they have fract_0


These parameter files are currently overwriting the parameter files of the main model. How can I get them to stop doing this?
```{r}
